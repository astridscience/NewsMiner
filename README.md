NewsMiner: Text Mining and Information Extraction from Newspaper PDFs



NewsMiner is a text mining project focused on extracting structured information from complex newspaper layouts, particularly multi-column PDFs. It aims to reconstruct full articles — including titles, authors, and publication dates — even when text is fragmented across visual blocks.



This project combines PDF parsing, layout detection, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enable large-scale newspaper data analysis.
